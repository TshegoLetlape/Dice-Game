<p>Logic behind the JavaScript code: Functions like gameRules() manage game rules visibility, while music() handles the Harry Potter theme song.
We set up variables and initializeGame() to start the game. switchPlayer() lets players take turns and updates scores. endGame() announces a winner after 6 plays. Wingardium Leviosa button is powered by rollDice() function, this updates scores and dice visuals. </p>
